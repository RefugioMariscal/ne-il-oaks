# Chicagoland Native Oaks

Created: Fall 2023

## Project Description
An interactive web map atlas of suitable habitat for eleven Chicagoland native oaks. This project was initially created as my (Refugio Mariscal) capstone project for the University of Arizona Master's in Geographic Information Systems Technology (MGIST) program. The purpose of this project is to create a habitat suitability model for oak trees native to the Illinois Chicagoland area. The model identifies areas where native oak trees are most likely to thrive based on historical data and current environmental variables.
